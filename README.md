Project Name: Flight Duration Optimizer

Proposal Link: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s-Xu_c9M2oWjZY2OOAzQg4LZDP7QpA1WAo0ioLozLsg/edit

Short Description:
This application would allow users to calculate the shortest flight duration between two airports. It is designed for travelers who want to find out the shortest possible travel time to get to another city regardless of other factors such as the ticket price, the total flight distance, and the convenience of departure/arrival time. Users can add/remove an airport, add/remove a flight, get the shortest travel duration between two airports and so on.

This project was completed with my classmates: Jiaqi He, Connor Kolb, Adam Gerkhardt, Owen Graham, Nicole Bennett, Lillian Peralta, and Liam Jogal 

Not all classmates files are included since all of us were in groups of 2 and wrote the same portion of the project, however, those included are cited at start of each file.
